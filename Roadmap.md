Phase 1. Research Paper
Finalize the project proposal
- define core problem statement
- project goals
- target users
Conduct in-depth research on existing AI disaster systems
-- Data Resources
-- API 
PAGASA, Phivolcs, public weather APIs, satelite data providers
Choosing technology stack (prog lang, cloud platforms)
Design System Architecture
- create diagrams for data flow
- database schema
- backend services

Phase 2. Data and AI development
data ingestion pipeline. write scripts to pull data from various APIs and store it in the database (the database is still in question, but someone told me to use NoSQL(MongoDB) i still need to be restudy SQL)
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Build and train the core AI models
- Natural Disaster Prediction - historical data to forecast typhoons, floods, or landslides
- Public Safety AI - build NLP model to perform natural sentiment analysis on social media feeds for security threats
Test.

Phase 3. Platform
Backend. Create API to serve data to the front-end.

how should we do the user authentication?

trigger alert.

Key features ideas.
- dynamic map, alert dashboard, user reports

Phase 4.  Testing. Deployment. Documentation

-- AI and Machine Learning --
Predictive Model. Regression Analysis. Decision Trees. Random forest.

Regression Analysis =  Rainfall, Volcano Eruption
Decision Trees and Random Forest = prediction flood risk


Deep Learning. analyzing image data
study CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) = for identifying cloud formations from satellite images or detecting changes in terrain from drone footages to predict landslides

Natural Learning Processing.
learn to process from the social media and news feeds. topics : sentiment analysis (public mood), text classification (categorizing alerts like "heavy traffic", f"fire", etc.)

Data Collection and integration. learn how APIs pull real-time data from sources like PAGASA, weather services and traffic APIs.

Understand Big Data/large data

Database Management.
structured profiles:user profile, report logs
unstructured: social media posts

Statistical analysis

Backend development - python.
- use rich ai libraries like tensorflow, scikit-learn, pytorch
- framework. django or flask to build the server side and APIs for mobile 

HTML, CSS, Javascript.
Frameworks,; react, vue.js

mobile development. react native/flutter - build for ios and android

cloud platforms. AWS, Google Cloud, MIcrosoft Azure

i'll need data storage (e.g s3, Google cloud storage)

data processing (AWS lambda, Google Cloud Functions)

Machine Learning (AWS SageMaker, Vertex AI)

Real-Time Data Processing (apache kafka or aws kinesis)

Project Management
UI/UX design
